Soliloquio de Shakespeare

To be, or not to be, that is the question.
Which is a more worthy action of the soul,
to endure the piercing blows of unjust fortune,
or to oppose the arms of this torrent of calamities,
and to put an end to them with bold resistance?
To die is to sleep. No more?
And by a sleep, shall we say, are afflictions ended
and the innumerable pains,
the heritage of our weak nature?...
This is a term we should eagerly seek.
To die is to sleep... and perhaps to dream.
Yes, and here you see the great obstacle,
for to consider what dreams
may occur in the silence of the grave,
when we have left this mortal wreck,
is a very powerful reason for stopping us.
This is the consideration that makes our unhappiness so long.
Who, if it were not for this, would endure the slowness of the courts,
the insolence of the clerks,
the outrages that peacefully receive
the merit of the most unworthy men,
the anguish of an ill-repaid love,
the injuries and injuries of age,
the violence of tyrants,
the contempt of the proud?
When he who suffers this,
could procure his tranquility with only a dagger.
Who could tolerate so much oppression, sweating,
groaning under the weight of a troublesome life
if it were not that the fear that there is something beyond Death
(that unknown country from whose limits no traveler returns)
embeds us in doubts
and makes us suffer the evils that surround us;
rather than go in search of others of which we have no certain knowledge?
This foresight makes us all cowards,
so the natural tint of courage is weakened
by the pale varnishes of prudence,
the most important undertakings
because of this sole consideration change course,
are not carried out and are reduced to vain designs.
But... beautiful Ophelia! Graceful girl,
I hope that my defects will not be forgotten in your prayers.
